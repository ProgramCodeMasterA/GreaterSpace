        <article class="Description">
            <p>There have been numerous studies on the ill effects on disorganizations and excess clutter can
                have on a persons mental health ranging from increased stress, anxiety and procrastination to
                implications for your physical health and personal relationships.
                <p>Having an organized space is
                    beneficial not only to your physical and mental wellbeing but also in regards to storing your
                    important possessions such as keys, jewellery, or important letters. An optimized living space can
                    help assign certain artefacts to specific locations so you know where they are when you need them
                    and
                    are not late to any important meetings or appointments because you cannot find what you are looking
                    for.
