        <p>Previous research shows that a cluttered or even a disorganised environment can not only have negative
            effects to your
            mental health such as depression, anxiety, and shame but can also impact your physical health with an
            increased risk
            of excess dust, mould or allergens which is especially dangerous for those with asthma.</p>
