            <p>Though each of the above designs may be different because of space constraints that differ between
                each household the common element in each of them is having your armchair/sofa positioned near the
                centre of the room with either a table or cabin next to where you spend most of your time while in
                the room. The reason for this is simply to have the essentials of what you need to be in a location
                that you will remember because it is in plain view and within arms reach when needed, for example:
                table with coasters next to chair, cupboard with cooking utensils next to oven, nightstand with
                important paperwork next to bed, all these instances demonstrate the importance of designing your
                living space so that is neat, tidy and functional.
